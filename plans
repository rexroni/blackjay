bugs / missing features:
    README for basic setup
    very small files only have a few different hmac/md5sum options, and it is obvious they are so small
    how does licensing work with other people's code
    need a rescue function (decrypt a whole tree of server stuff based on password)
    encrypted filenames
    need password checks
    more error checking on socket comms?
    timeout after watchdog fires before it fires again
    there is no atomic functionality to sever connections right now
    server doesn't open port back up when it shuts down
    python 2.7 for maximum portability

# protocol steps:
#    client says:                  server says:
#--------------------------------------------------------------
#1   give me metadata
#2                                 Here is metadata
#3   here are changes/pullreqs
#4                                 Here are files / I am honoring these changes
#                     (both write to files)
