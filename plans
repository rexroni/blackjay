state machine:

situation:      solution:
lu ru:          pull file.server_version.ext as read-only file
lu rd:          just push file back
ld ru:          pull remote update
ld rd:          we're good

metadata for each file on server:
hash during last sync

metadata for each file on client:
hash at last sync (HALS)
time of last update
deletion flag
was_conflicted

sync protocol:
    client already has list of local updates/deletions
    client connects to server
    server sends all metadata
    client calculates conflicts
    client dictates which files go where

all conflicts are of the form:
    local file's HALS is different than server's file's TOLS

Never push a file if it's file.server_version exists
the first time you detect file.server_version is deleted, force push



modules:
    server.py: daemon, server side

    client.py: communication with server

    daemon.py: daemon, client side: watches files, initiates push/pulls

    file_encryption.py: give it a file, it hands back an encrypted file



whats left:
    network functionality
    encryption
    watchdog integrated path pattern matching
    os.walk might have some pattern matching
    need to move files in big batches


bugs:
    watchdog fires after syncing happens
    lots of empty syncs (maybe just better timeouts)
    file encryption completed
    ssh stdin/out ssh forwarding
    README for basic setup
    writing to conflicted file shouldn't set found_update=true while comflict file exists
    very small files only have a few different hmac/md5sum options, and it is obvious they are so small





# protocol steps:
#    client says:                  server says:
#--------------------------------------------------------------
#1   give me metadata
#2                                 Here is metadata
#3   here are changes/pullreqs
#4                                 Here are files / I am honoring these changes
#                     (both write to files)


## This is what archiver does:
file system on:
      client:                       server:

1      <empty>                      <empty>

2      <empty>                      <empty>
