bugs / missing features:
    README for basic setup
    very small files only have a few different hmac/md5sum options, and it is obvious they are so small
    how does licensing work with other people's code
    need a rescue function (decrypt a whole tree of server stuff based on password)
    encrypted filenames
    need password checks
    more error checking on socket comms?
    timeout after watchdog fires before it fires again
    there is no atomic functionality to sever connections right now
    sign server and clients with key that way client executables only work with the server that they are signed with, this allows the clients to verify the server isn't perorming a mitm attack against them
    server no longer initializes new folders...
    client doesn't work in python2

# protocol steps:
#    client says:                  server says:
#--------------------------------------------------------------
#1   give me metadata
#2                                 Here is metadata
#3   here are changes/pullreqs
#4                                 Here are files / I am honoring these changes
#                     (both write to files)


To be even reasonably efficient, our application really needs a mutex on an object that lists files that are being read/written currently.  That way two threads can handle different files simultaneously.

Probably for first release, something simpler is better.
