bugs / missing features:
    README for basic setup
    very small files only have a few different hmac/md5sum options, and it is obvious they are so small
    how does licensing work with other people's code
    need a rescue function (decrypt a whole tree of server stuff based on password)
    encrypted filenames
    need password checks
    more error checking on socket comms?
    need network robustness testing

# protocol steps:
#    client says:                  server says:
#--------------------------------------------------------------
#1   give me metadata
#2                                 Here is metadata
#3   here are changes/pullreqs
#4                                 Here are files / I am honoring these changes
#                     (both write to files)
