How to install blackjay to run on startup

Linux client installation (via systemd):
    # copy example blackjay client service file to systemd directory
    sudo cp blackjayclient.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
    # now edit that example file
    sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/blackjayclient.service
        # edit the User= and ExecStart= to be appropriate
    # now enable the service on boot (--now starts it now as well)
    sudo systemctl enable --now blackjayclient.service
    # later, if you want to uninstall
    sudo systemctl disable --now blackjayclient.service

Linux server installation (via systemd):
    # copy example blackjay server service file to systemd directory
    sudo cp blackjayserver.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
    # now edit that example file
    sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/blackjayserver.service
        # edit the User= and ExecStart= to be appropriate
    # now enable the service on boot (--now starts it now as well)
    sudo systemctl enable --now blackjayserver.service
    # later, if you want to uninstall
    sudo systemctl disable --now blackjayserver.service

Windows client installation (via Task Scheduler):
    First, edit the windows_client.bat file to have appropriate paths
    Then, to run the .bat file on startup:
        Click Windows start button
        type "Task Scheduler" and hit enter
        on right side, click "Create Task"
        name the task "blackjay"
        under the "Triggers" tab:
            click "New"
            in drop-down menu, select "At Startup"
            click "OK"
        under the "Actions" tab:
            click "Browse"
            select windows_client.bat
            click "OK"
        click "OK"
    # later, if you want to uninstall
    in the Task Scheduler, on the left side, click on "Task Scheduler Library"
    In the top-center panel, right-click on "blackjay" and select "Delete"

    # additional first steps:
    connect through ssh one time in order to verify host keys of the server
    enable python to access the network (there should be a pop-up when you run the program)


Suggested Network Architecture:
    - the server runs the blackjay server.py, on some port BLACKJAY_PORT
    - the server runs an ssh server on some other port SSH_PORT
    - the blackjay client needs to know the necessary information to establish an ssh connection.  This information includes:
        - username on the server for which ssh access has been established
        - location of private ssh key on the client filesystem
        - hostname of the server
        - SSH_PORT on the server
    - The blackjay client also needs the BLACKJAY_PORT, so after establishing an ssh tunnel it will be able to find the blackjay program running on the server
